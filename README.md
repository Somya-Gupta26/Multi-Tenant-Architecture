# Multi-Tenant Architecture (Cloud Infrastructure Automation & Deployment Pipelines) (Sample Project)

This is a **generic, NDA-safe sample project** inspired by the type of work I handled during my Cloud & DevOps internship.  
The aim is to demonstrate skills in **Terraform, AWS, CI/CD, automation, and multi-tenant pipeline workflows** without exposing any proprietary organizational code.

## 🚀 Project Overview

During my internship, I contributed to a major industry-level project—along with several other tasks—where I automated cloud infrastructure provisioning and deployment workflows using AWS services, Terraform modules, and CI/CD pipelines.  
This sample repository recreates a simplified version of those concepts:

- Multi-tenant environment structure  
- Infrastructure provisioning using Terraform  
- Automated CI/CD pipeline simulation    
- Secure handling of configuration using variables and environment files

## 🧱 Architecture (Simplified)

Client A / Client B / Client C
│
▼
Terraform Modules
(VPC, Lambda, IAM and more)
│
▼
AWS Infrastructure


The real project included multiple pipelines, dynamic client onboarding, environment-specific deployments, and integration with organizational tooling.  
This sample provides a safe, open-source demonstration.

---

## 📦 Sample Terraform Features

### ✔ Modular Architecture  
Reusable modules for:
- IAM role creation  
- Lambda deployment  

### ✔ Multi-Tenant Ready  
The structure supports:
- Separate workspaces
- Per-client variables  
- Consistent infrastructure replication

### ✔ Easy Deployment
